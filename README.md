# Tourism Activity Recommendation System 🌍

## Introduction 📝

This repository contains our final project for the course "Knowledge Representation and Reasoning". It's a Tourism Activity Recommendation System designed to suggest activities based on user preferences such as the number of people, weather conditions, and types of activities. The system is built using Python and Streamlit, providing a user-friendly web interface for activity suggestions.

## Technology Stack 🛠️

- **Python**: The core programming language used for the development of the recommendation logic.
- **Streamlit**: A Python framework for creating beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science projects.
- **CSV Files**: Used for storing and reading the list of activities, allowing for easy updates and management.
